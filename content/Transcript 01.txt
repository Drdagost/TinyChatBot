PoggleBase Quantum Hardware Meeting
Date: August 20, 2025
Participants: Dr. Mensa (Quantum IT Director), Mr. Gurathin (Development Manager), Mr. Rathi (Senior Developer), Ms. Bharadwaj (Solution Lead).

11:00 AM
Dr. Mensa: Alright team, let's get started. Thanks for joining. We're here to discuss the ongoing challenges with the PoggleBase hardware component—specifically, the non-linear optical crystals and the parametric downconversion process. The reports from the pilot deployments are clear: this setup is a significant roadblock to wider adoption. I want to hear your thoughts on the core issues and, more importantly, a path forward. Mr. Rathi, let's start with you on the technical side.

11:07 AM
Mr. Rathi: Thanks, Dr. Mensa. The core issue is instability. The Beta Barium Borate crystals—the BBO—are incredibly sensitive. First, thermal drift is a huge problem. Even a one-degree Celsius change in ambient temperature causes the phase-matching condition to shift, and our laser alignment is off. We're getting a yield of entangled photons that's barely 10% of what we see in the lab. It's just not a production-ready setup.

11:13 AM
Mr. Gurathin: And that instability translates directly to our bottom line. My team is spending an unacceptable amount of time on-site recalibrating these modules. Each recalibration requires a specialist, a controlled environment, and about four hours of downtime. The cost of labor and travel is eating into our profit margins, and the unreliability is damaging our reputation with clients.

11:20 AM
Ms. Bharadwaj: From the client's perspective, this is a showstopper. They don't care about the physics behind "parametric downconversion"; they just want a solution that works. They were sold on instantaneous data retrieval, but they're getting a fragile black box that requires constant baby-sitting. Our last pilot client, Innovate Dynamics, reported a 40% reduction in system uptime due to these hardware issues. They've put their full rollout on hold.

11:27 AM
Dr. Mensa: This is unacceptable. We can't build a business on a product that's so fundamentally unstable outside of a lab. We need to pivot. What are our options?

11:34 AM
Mr. Rathi: We've been looking at some alternatives. The ideal solution would be a solid-state or on-chip photonics approach. Instead of a bulk crystal, we could use integrated waveguides on a silicon chip to generate the entangled pairs. This would be immune to thermal drift, vibration, and general environmental noise. The challenge is that the technology is still in its nascent stages.

11:41 AM
Ms. Bharadwaj: Could we create a hardware product for our clients? Something we call a "Quantum Entanglement Module," or QEM. It would be a fully sealed, pre-calibrated unit that clients can just plug in. We'd handle the complexity on our end and just send them a finished product.

11:48 AM
Mr. Gurathin: I like that idea. We could partner with a hardware manufacturer who specializes in this. It shifts the burden of maintenance from our field technicians to a controlled factory environment. We'd have a higher upfront cost, but it would drastically reduce long-term support and maintenance expenses.

11:53 AM
Dr. Mensa: That sounds like a solid two-pronged approach. Mr. Rathi, I want you to head up a research initiative into the on-chip photonics. Give me a feasibility report in two weeks. Gurathin, can you begin a cost-benefit analysis on the QEM concept? Identify potential manufacturing partners and put together a preliminary business case.

11:58 AM
Ms. Bharadwaj: And I'll work with marketing to create a new client roadmap. We need to be transparent about the challenges and show them that a more robust solution is on the way. We'll position the QEM as the next evolution of PoggleBase hardware, which will excite our clients and give them a reason to stay.

12:00 PM
Dr. Mensa: Excellent. Rathi, your report is due on September 15th. Gurathin, let's target the end of the month for your business case. Ms. Bharadwaj, please have a draft of the client communication plan by the end of this week. Let's schedule a follow-up for October 1st to review these findings. Meeting adjourned.
